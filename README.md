# SwaddleSwap_ServiceLayers
Repositories and tasks to complete the service layers for Swaddle Swap design.
#My idea is to create a site where parents can rent a swaddle for up to 2 weeks and try them before they buy them. They will be able to go on the site, create an account and complete a sleep quiz. That quiz will suggest 5 swaddles for them to try during the trial period. At the end of the trial period they need to select which swaddles theyâ€™d like to return and which swaddles they would like to purchase.
